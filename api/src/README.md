To install and run a Flask app in the `/c:/Git/emotion-detection/api/src/` folder, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `/c:/Git/emotion-detection/api/src/` folder using the `cd` command.
3. Create a virtual environment by running the command `python -m venv venv`. This will create a new folder named `venv` which will contain the virtual environment.
4. Activate the virtual environment by running the command `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows, or `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux.
5. Install Flask by running the command `pip install flask`.
6. Open a command window in VS Code and run flask `--app api\src\app.py run`.
7. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see your Flask app running.
